## Data Visualization Tool
- This is a program written in Java that displays data based on the most complete data from the Titanic
- This is a dataset I have used in other projects that shows the passenger's ages, gender, class, ticket price, siblings aboard, parents aboard, and where they departed.

## Features
- You can select a record of each passenger to see more details about them.
- You can filter through gender, survival status, and passenger class.
- The program features a bar chart that can be filtered by passenger class, gender, and age groups.
- The program will show running statistics based on filtered data. By default it displays stats for the total passengers.
  
## How to run
- Simply run the `main.java` file
